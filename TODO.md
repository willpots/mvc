During the first four months of development, the Midd Ventures site went from a concept to an early stage beta, ready for a public release. While the feature set of the site had to be reduced, the initial version features the ability to draft news posts and catalog people and groups in the database. In addition, the backend has been completed with all relations between people, groups and articles. For next steps, Midd Ventures will need to gather and input data regarding existing Middlebury startups. To do so, I will be working with the paid PCI intern to gather information for the site. Liz Robinson is presenting the site at the board of trustees meeting and I will attempt to be in the room to aid the presentation.
